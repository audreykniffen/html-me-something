            <h3>Holiday Gift-Giving</h3>
            <p> Animals are perfect, they are certainly more deserving of a reward than any human. However, the humans in your life will porobably take offense if you spend more money and time finding just the right present for an animal, instead of reciprocating their displays of gratitudy. If you are struggling with this, simply gift the gifts at seperate times and avoid social media. Good News! Like animals, the humanoids enjoy treats and mindless distractions as well. </p>
