        <h3>Holiday Gift-Giving</h3>
        <p> Animals are perfect, they are certainly more deserving of a reward than any human. However, the humans in your life will porobably take offense if you spend more money and time finding just the right present for an animal, instead of reciprocating their displays of gratitudy. If you are struggling with this, simply present the gifts at seperate times and avoid social media. Good News! Like animals, the humanoids enjoy treats and mindless distractions as well. If you succeed in distracting them, your ruse will be successful. </p>

        <p> When facing an encounter with a youth of your species, it is important to always provide them with a small, soft statue of an animal. This will teach them to avoid humans and always seek interaction with animals. Children are the future caretakers of animals after all, and this small investment will surely pay off in dividends.</p>
